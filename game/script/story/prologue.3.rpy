    Fris "Fascinating! So it really is true."

    d "What, you’re shocked that you have five fingers? Did you expect to have more? Is that not normal for you freaks?"

    Fris "And not only are they capable of intelligent speech, they also happen to speak Risenian!"

    elo "I don’t know if that’s ever what we’ve called our language."

    Fris "Never in a thousand years would I have believed the rumors to be true. Just fantastic. This will be much easier than I thought."

    nar "And so this next person coming from the gates actually acknowledged us first. All to ask us how many fingers he was holding up...in order to prove that we’re not savages?"

    Fris "I must find out more about this land. You there, tribal folk-people! I have a favor you must fulfill."

    d "A favor? Hah! Can’t you see that no one’s around?"

    elo "Durs!"

    Fris "Hmm. Most interesting. Do they also make consideration of kingdom renown? Tribal folk-man, I hear your reasoning well. However I could not let this opportunity pass. You see, I Doctor Rightstahl of foreign studies have a unique and special interest in your type. Unfortunately our field is quite bare, and I’d like to ask just a few questions to advance my humble research."

    d "Yeah right. Research my big blue bottom as we walk away."

    elo "Wait, Durs. He says he’s a doctor. Maybe he’ll know how to cure you."

    rights "Cure? Well that should be no sweat for a man like I."

    elo "Like \“me\”?"

    rights "That’s doubtful."

    nar "Never mind."

    d "..."

    rights "\*ahem\* Perhaps if you’re not satisfied with our lack of audience here, we can at least trade a favor for a favor. Spare me a few answers, and I’ll spare you a bit of my talent."

    elo "Alright. Ask away, sir."

    rights "Ok first question. Is the legal use of tender in your tribal folk-village an exchange of objects with intrinsic value or are they representative of some sort of bullion claimed from a federal source?"

    d "Yes."

    elo "Federal?"

    d "Wait, is this really happening?"

    rights "Ohhhkay then. Next question. In powering your tribal homes, does your kind lean toward direct current or have you thought to apply the wonders of alternating current?"

    d "Ok hold up. I think we’ve answered enough questions for this man already. We all have five fingers, ok? But usually seven toes. Go write that on your humble research report."

    elo "Durs, please."

    d "You’re unbelievable, Elorey. I told you we’re not pleading for help from the kind of people who aren’t willing to follow through."

    elo "But he IS willing!"

    d "You know what, man? Want to know what’s current in our tribe? Fine. See this lady here? She makes the most awful tasting pies with blackcurrant. Sticks the currant directly there. And doesn’t even think about alternating recipes. Just the same disgusting dessert every celebration. Satisfied with that?"

    rights "What?"

    nar "Literally shaking my head."

    d "Great. Let’s go, Elorey."

    elo "Go where? This could all be over right here, if you would just calm down."

    d "Not with this guy. He’s bluffing. He doesn’t know squat. Don’t you let him waste my time here, woman. We’re done here."

    elo "Ignore him, sir. He’ll be better once he’s cured."

    rights "Er...we’re talking about a cure for what exactly?"

    elo "A cure for the longing heart. Hey, how about we start with that actually. This’ll go a lot faster if we just-"

    rights "Did you say longing heart? As in the one that turns people into ravenous, raging monsters?"

    elo "Goodness, I hope not that one."

    rights "Um. Oh. Yeah. Not that one. That would be quite the predicamental problem you’d be having, wouldn’t it?. I’ve probably never heard of this, um, \“wronging heart\” disease you say he might probably - er, possibly possess. So... this may certainly come as a situationally shocking surprise to the two of you, but I think there’s probably nothing I can do to help you in this current happenstance. I hope."

    elo "You hope?"

    rights "Yes, hope...all the beast - er, best to you and your monster - er, mister, in finding a cure, and such."

    elo "So you have nothing for us?"

    rights "I’ve deep knowledge in nearly all things but what you’re looking for, I’m afraid. Shocking, shocking, yes. You probably won’t find anything like that in our kingdom. Perhaps you tribal people should look elsewhere?"

    d "That’s the largest load of droppings to fall on my ears this whole trip."

    elo "Please, sir. There’s really nothing you know of that would help? The sickness manifests repeatedly in Carna, but we hear your kingdom is free of it."

    rights "Is that so? Well, I think I’ll add that there’s this beautiful land just south of here known for its gifted use of medicine and cures. We often make trade with them, probably. It might be a decent idea to look there, no?"

    elo "Huh? There’s nothing but ocean that way!"

    rights "Oh. Really? Yeah, you probably just cross that and..."

    elo "..."

    d "..."

    rights "They’re not buying it..."

    elo "..."

    rights "Wow, look over there! A cure!"

    elo "Huh? Hey!"

    nar "He dashed off!"

    d "Did I really just watch you fall for that? You don’t listen to me, Elorey. That’s a horrible attribute for a wife to have. It’s almost as bad as your lack of judgement. I need you to shut up and do what I say until we’re inside."

    elo "Durs...just..."

    d "You’ve got something else to say now?"

    elo "... You said you loved my pies. That’s why I keep making them."

    d "Oh come on. Still on it? I was lying to make you feel worth something."

    elo "You enjoyed it... You were happy."

    d "See, that’s your biggest problem. You couldn’t read a person’s face if your life depended on it. All I have to do is put on a cheesy smile, and you’re immediately satisfied. But I’m still sitting at the table, violating my tastebuds with this garbage left by your filthy hands. Those things are hardly worth wiping the floors clean let alone cooking something edible."

    elo "This thing has the ring you gave me with a promise..."

    d "Oh boy."

    elo "To love me forever no matter what... Was that a lie too?"

    d "All lies. Hey what do you know, that’s my biggest problem, isn’t it? I tell the worst of lies and you bake the worst of pies. A brilliant combination. "

    elo "Brilliant?"

    d "Oh sure. Makes for a pretty appalling pair of people, huh?"

    elo "Durs. How do I even..."

    dis "How do I even put words to what he’s making me go through? Or to what he’s going through... He’s right. I can’t read a person for what it’s worth. This whole time he’s never cared or loved. Even before the longing. These words aren’t being created by this evil disease of his. They are truths from long before. Finally allowed to spill because he’s not bound anymore by guilt. This new heart has revealed what he most longed for...to put me in my place. Not true? Have I misjudged the whole situation again? I hope to death he proves me wrong one more time."
