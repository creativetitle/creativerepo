    elo "Durs!"

    Fris "Hmm.{w=.25} Most interesting.{w=.25} Do they also make consideration of kingdom renown?"
    Fris "Tribal folk-man,{w=.1} I hear your reasoning well.{w=.25} However I could not let this opportunity pass."
    Fris "You see, I Doctor Rightstahl of foreign studies have a unique and special interest in your type."
    Fris "Unfortunately our field is quite bare,{w=.1} and I’d like to ask just a few questions to advance my humble research."

    d "Wait, is this really happening?"

    rights "Ohhhkay then. Next question."
    rights "In powering your tribal homes, does your kind lean toward direct current{nw}"
    rights "or have you thought to apply the wonders of alternating current?"

    d "Ok hold up.{w=.1} I think we’ve answered enough questions for this man already."
    d "We all have five fingers, ok?{w=.25} But usually seven toes.{w=.25} Go write that on your humble research report."

    elo "Durs,{w=.1} please."

    d "You’re unbelievable, Elorey.{w} I told you we’re not pleading for help from the kind of people who aren’t willing to follow through."

    d "You know what, man?{w=.25} Want to know what’s current in our tribe?{w=.25} Fine."
    d "See this lady here?{w=.1} She makes the most awful tasting pies with blackcurrant."
    d "Sticks the currant directly there. And doesn’t even think about alternating recipes.{nw}"
    d "Just the same disgusting dessert every celebration.{w} Satisfied with that?"

    rights "What?"

    nar "Literally shaking my head."

    d "Great.{w} Let’s go, Elorey."

    elo "Go where?{w=.25} This could all be over right here, if you would just calm down."

    d "Not with this guy.{w=.1} He’s bluffing.{w=.1} He doesn’t know squat.{w=.25} Don’t you let him waste my time here, woman.{w=.25} We’re done here."

    elo "Ignore him, sir. He’ll be better once he’s cured."

    rights "Er...{w=.25}we’re talking about a cure for what exactly?"

    elo "A cure for the longing heart.{w=.25} Hey, how about we start with that actually.{w=.25} This’ll go a lot faster if we just-"

    rights "Did you say longing heart? As in the one that turns people into ravenous, raging monsters?"

    elo "Goodness, I hope not that one."

    rights "Um.{w=.1} Oh.{w=.1} Yeah.{w=.1} Not that one.{w} That would be quite the predicamental problem you’d be having, wouldn’t it?"
    rights "I’ve probably never heard of this, um, \"wronging heart\" disease you say he might probably -{w=.1} er, possibly possess."
    rights "So...{w=.25} this may certainly come as a situationally shocking surprise to the two of you,"
    rights "but I think there’s probably nothing I can do to help you in this current happenstance.{w} I hope."

    elo "You hope?"

    rights "Yes, hope...{w=.25} all the beast -{w=.1} er, best to you and your monster -{w=.1} er, mister, in finding a cure,{w} and such."

    elo "So you have nothing for us?"

    rights "I’ve deep knowledge in nearly all things but what you’re looking for, I’m afraid."
    rights "Shocking, shocking, yes.{w} You probably won’t find anything like that in our kingdom."
    rights "Perhaps you tribal people should look elsewhere?"

    d "That’s the largest load of droppings to fall on my ears this whole trip."

    elo "Please, sir. There’s really nothing you know of that would help?{w=.25} The sickness manifests repeatedly in Carna, but we hear your kingdom is free of it."

    rights "Is that so? Well,{w=.1} I think I’ll add that there’s this beautiful land just south of here known for its gifted use of medicine and cures.{nw}"
    rights "we often make trade with them, probably.{w=.25} It might be a decent idea to look there, no?"

    elo "Huh?{w=.1} There’s nothing but ocean that way!"

    rights "Oh.{w=.1} Really?{w=.1} Yeah, you probably just cross that and.{w=.1}.{w=.1}."
