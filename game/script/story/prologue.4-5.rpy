    Sris "Oh my. Neither of you look so well. That man. I know well of what ails him. The longing heart, is it not? And you. That head wound also looks grave."

    e "Save him please..."

    Sris "Don’t tell me you’ve dragged this helpless man all the way here from where you came. What a foolish act to come alone considering the conditions you two are in."

    Sris "Nonetheless, I see an act of sheer grit. I don’t believe I’ve met a person with a heart half as strong as yours must be, young lady."

    nar "Maybe it looks like strength to him, but I can barely even stand now. This head injury is taking a toll. If anything was strong, it was the force of that blow. It was almost inhuman."

    Sris "Oh but this heart hasn’t much time, I see. And the same goes for him. You’ll come onto my horse and I’ll take you to my house. I think I can treat both of you there. Thankfully I live on the very outskirts of the land, not too far from the walls. Can you climb on?"

    e "Yes. Thank you...sir."

    Sris "Awake again?"

    e "Hmmm..."

    Sris "We’re almost there, milady."

    e "Please. It’s Elorey."

    Sris "Ah, Elorey. My name is Lidmund. Unfortunate we had to meet under such circumstances. You hail from Carna, do you not?"

    e "Carna. Yes."

    lid "And this man. He’s your..."

    e "He’s my husband. Durs."

    lid "Ah. What a prize that truly is. To have someone to love in the prime of one’s youth. Yes, much unlike my own, er - never mind me and my love life, er - youth. Or - lack thereof... of either? Neither? Um... Say, how about some more talk about yourself? Do you have any other family? Children perhaps?"

    e "Family, yes. I have a sister."

    lid "That’s wonderful. Another gift, would you say?"

    e "Mostly I guess. Not so much lately. I’m sure she’s furious at me for leaving. But anyway. Children, no. Not yet at least. Soon I hope. I guess."

    nar "I rub my stomach. The thought gives me a mix of joy and grief I would like to take off my mind at the moment."

    lid "Your husband... I can tell you love him very much."

    e "I do... I still do... I just wonder if he’d say the same..."

    lid "I see. The longing heart has really taken a toll on you two. What a horrible thing. Elorey, I wouldn’t listen to a word he’s said since the disease struck. Those words are cruel lies originating from nothing but the sickness itself."

    e "That’s what he said too. All lies."

    lid "You need to believe me, Elorey. Not the monster that’s taken control of him. "

    nar "Isn’t my biggest fault believing people?"

    lid "None of that was or ever had been the truth. That is that."

#Horse sound stops

    lid "Aha, and we’re here."

    lid "You see the castle way out there? And the walls over there? Indeed, even within the kingdom’s boundaries, it feels like I live in the middle of nowhere."

    e "It’s beauti -"

    lid "Woah!"

    nar "I nearly fell off his horse."

    scene bg_discourse with newscene #Lidmund's entrance

    lid "Right. Let’s get that head taken care of first."

    nar "I still can’t believe it ended like that. Could have been my last conversation with Durs too, if he doesn’t get better."

    e "Will he be alright?"

    lid "Our other friend here, I’m afraid will take a little more time and effort to fix. It’s important we get your own strength up. And I think I’ll need the extra hands."

    dis "Can he really do it? Fix Durs? Do I really want him fixed? Does he really want to be fixed? This sickness has finally given him the freedom from guilt he’s longed for, and I could be stealing that away. I could leave him here to die as he wants, and I’ll have my own freedom at last. I can raise this child on my own."
    dis "..."
    dis "Wow, this whole thing seems to have brought the worst out of me too. That’s not how I really feel. I want my husband back more than anything. We’re going home, Durs."
