	lid "Alright. How do you feel now, Elorey?"

	elo "Much better. Your healing work is pretty miraculous."

	lid "Glad to hear."

	elo "I have no doubt now you can save Durs."

	lid "Excellent. We’ll get straight to it then. What we need to do first, as you might have imagined, is drain all the excess fluid. I’m going to gradually relieve pressure directly from his vena cava with this needle. When I tell you, slowly lift his arms so as to drain them without exploding anything."

	elo "E-exploding?"

	lid "I’m sorry... I guess that was a bit insensitively morbid."

	elo "Ok... And then?"

	lid "And then... Well then the same for his legs."

	elo "And that’s it?"

	lid "That’s, as I said, only the first step. After his pressure is standard, the rest of his blood will still be filled with the poison of his longing."

	elo "Do you have normal blood to give him?"

	lid "Oh, I wish it were as simple as a transfusion. The only way is for his body to naturally excrete the corrupted blood on its own. Not only that, it must be sure to replace it with clean blood. It’s a long wait of a process."

	elo "How do we know he’s producing clean blood?"

	lid "That’s...another long process of its own. But before any of that, let’s finish step one, shall we?"

	elo "Do you really have the means to cure my husband fully?"

	lid "Elorey, the longing heart is no simple disease. A lot of this rides on him too."

	elo "On him?"

	d "Grrr..."

	lid "Oh boy. Really, we should save the talk for later. Just follow what I say."

	elo "..."

	lid "Alright, he’s draining. Remember, lift slowly when I say."

	d "-those filthy hands off me right now, stupid woman..."

	nar "Oh no. Wrong time to be waking back up, Durs."

	d "Filthy things... Am I about to show you again what happens when you touch me without reason?"

	lid "Oh dear. You have to stay down, Durs. At the moment I don’t think your heart can stand the fluid pressure from your head."

	d "Great glories, who is this now? Are you seriously..."

	elo "Durs, head down!"

	d "Are you seriously doing EXACTLY WHAT YOU’VE BEEN TOLD NOT TO DO? The one moment I’m unconscious and you think it’s okay to disobey me. You don’t ask for help, you shut your mouth."

	elo "This man is helping for real!"

	d "He’s got a giant freaking needle in my chest! I call this helping me die! Remember what I said about your judgement? Let me judge this guy for you. LUNATIC!"

	lid "Excuse me?"

	elo "Durs, this is not the best moment to be throwing your insults."

	d "Me throwing the insults? The only insult here is yourself. It’s all I can bear to deal with your dreadful insubordination, and now you’ve brought me in the face of this mocking fool as well."

	lid "Alright this has to be done fast."

	d "What’s that, sir? You want to see if I have a tail? Huh? You want to know I like my meat cooked? RARE!"

	lid "What’s he saying now?"

	elo "Durs, he’s helping us!"

	d "NO MORE HELP WOMAN."

	lid "More? Dear lords...have our people put them through trouble already?"

	elo "Durs, that’s why we came here. To find help."

	nar "He’s lost it."

	d "For the last time, I’m the one finding help, and you’re standing by, looking ugly."

	elo "Oh I’m ugly now?"

	d "You broke our bedroom mirror!"

	elo "That again? That was for a different-"

	lid "He’s standing! Hold him down!"

	elo "Huh? Why are you asking me? He’s twice my- three times my size now!"

	lid "Hold his mouth shut too."

	d "Keep those hands away from-mmmrphhgh!"

	lid "Ok I’ll hold him. You take the needle."

	d "Get off me, you hollow-headed hypocrite!"

	lid "Excuse me sir. It would assist us all greatly if you wouldn’t resist our help so...ferociously."

	elo "What do I do?"

	lid "Keep draining, him, Elorey."

	d "Urghk! No Elorey, stop! It’s killing me!"

	elo "You’re almost there, Durs!"

	lid "Ok, I’m lifting his arms! Keep going! And slowly!"

	d "Guaahh! My shoulder!"

	lid "Eeek! His shoulder!"

	nar "The man has successfully dislocated my husband’s two arms."

	lid "Not good!"

	d "Darn freaking right, looniac!"

	elo "Sit back down, Durs!"

	d "Arrrgghh! You wretch! This is the last time I let you-"

	nar "Strike. Another strike. Just like when he hit me that first time by the gates... He was so mad. It hurt on the outside for sure. But even more agonizing was realizing that the man I love could be driven so far by hatred."

	ldurs "ROOOAAR."

	nar "Strike. But this time he doesn’t stop and call it a warning. It’s as if all he’s ever longed for was to have me suffer for what I’ve done. Each hit gets more painful than the last. His wish being finally granted gives rise to his strength. Strike. Strike. Never mind. The physical pain is worse."

	dis "That man. Lidmund. Maybe he was one in a thousand, and the rest of them really are \"starch-collared highlives\" as Durs said. Unwilling to let down their stubborn barriers and help someone who truly needs it. I suppose they’ve never encountered the need for anything themselves. The idea of longing must be entirely foreign to them. And what is foreign to a man gives way to fear. This series of events will only shatter their broken image of us outsiders. If there were even a handful more Risenians as understanding as Lidmund had been, there sure won't be once word gets out. \"The Carnaites are a bunch of destructive monsters.\""

	dis "And just think of how this affects us in Carna. Look at what what fear has done to those like Durs. What’s foreign to us has become a source of distrust and hate that has built up over generations. Carna. Do whatever pleases you. As long as you stay in the village. That considered, our lands are much alike. Bound by different ideals, yet stuck in our own little worlds. I left my little world with the intention of saving my husband. But I had one other ambition. I wanted to give our people hope in something beyond the never ending pursuit of insufficient pleasure. The hope that there’s a perfect place out there where people are willing to set aside their judgements, to provide a light only they can provide, and redeem those who are doomed to eternal longing. It turns out Durs and I have painted the very opposite picture for everyone back home. My people will hear about this, and make their hearts harder. Elmina, Macal, will you ever find it in yourselves to forgive them? Or is the idea of salvation lost for good?"
